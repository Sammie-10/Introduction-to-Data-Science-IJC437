Air quality and more specifically PM2.5 (Particulate Matter that is 2.5 µm in diameter), is classed as a major pollutant across the world. The size of PM2.5 allows it to easily enter our lungs and blood stream causing health risks such as cancer. Having a better understanding on preventative methods for PM2.5 can help improve public health. This project specifcally uses different analytical techniques using R to determine if rain has an effect on PM2.5 in the atmosphere in Sheffield.
