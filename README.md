Air quality and more specifically PM2.5 (Particulate Matter that is 2.5 µm in diameter), is classed as a major pollutant across the world. The size of PM2.5 allows it to easily enter our lungs and blood stream causing health risks such as cancer. Having a better understanding on preventative methods for PM2.5 can help improve public health. This project specifcally uses different analytical techniques using R to determine if rain has an effect on PM2.5 in Sheffield (2024). 
the research questions for this study were: 
                How do the variables change when changed from hourly to daily.
                Is there a significant relationship between PM2.5 (µg/m3) and rainfall (mm).
                Does lagged PM2.5 data change the significance of the relationship between PM2.5 (µg/m3)  and rain (mm).
The results from this data analysis suggest rain has no significant effect on PM2.5.
